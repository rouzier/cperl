=head1 NAME

exact_arith - promote on overflow to bigint/num

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use exact_arith;
    print 18446744073709551614 * 2; # => 36893488147419103228, a Math::BigInt object

    { no exact_arith;
      print 18446744073709551614 * 2; # => 3.68934881474191e+19
    }

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is a new lexical user-pragma since cperl5.27.2 to use exact
arithmetic, without loosing precision on all builtin integer
arithmetic ops.  As in perl6, but only for integer arithmetic and much
faster.

There's no noticible performance hit. It's much faster than
perl6, since it only does use bigint on IV/UV overflows which do
happen very seldom.

When L<Math::BigInt::GMP> is available it is preferred, otherwise it
falls back to L<Math::BigInt>.

=head1 32-BIT WARNING

On most ivsize = 4 32bit systems with 64bit integer support, either
soft via quadmath or hard via the native 64bit CPU, an integer larger
than 32bit will always be represented as NV, as a double. So there
will be never be an integer overflow detection, and there will never
be exact arithmetic on overlarge numbers.

You need to use large IV's then, via C<-Duse64bitint>.

Only on very rare old 32bit machines without 64bit support
(i.e. without d_quad, without i64size==8) 32bit integer arithmetic
will trigger an overflow.
